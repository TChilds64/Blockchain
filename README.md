# Blockchain
This project is designed to analyze hashes from the Bitcoin blockchain.
For a given file of hashes, the program completes a frequency analysis for each index of the hash,
and a string is that represents the most common character at each index.



The .txt file can be used to immediately test the hashAnalysis program. Hashes are from fall of 2021.
The getBitcoinBlocks file is used to get the hashes of the newest 500 blocks from the Bitcoin blockchain.
